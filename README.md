- Introduction
- Data gathering
- Data assessing
- Data cleaning
- Exploratory Data analysis


## INTRODCUTION 
WhatsApp is one of the most used messenger applications today with more than 2 Billion users worldwide. It was found that more than 65 billion messages are sent on WhatsApp daily so we can use WhatsApp chats for analyzing our chat with a friend, customer, or a group of people. 

In this project, I will take you through the task of WhatsApp Chat Analysis with Python.

## DATA GATHERING 
Before starting with the task of WhatsApp Chat analysis with Python I needed to extract the WhatsApp data from my smartphone which is a very easy task. To extract the WhatsApp chats I did the following:
- I opened a WhatsApp chat with a friend of mine.
- I then tapped on  the 3 dots above.
- Then scroll to the bottom and tap on Export Chat.
- I selected without media for simplicity as this will make the analysis faster.
- I then emailed the chat to myself for downloading.

## DATA ASSESSING 

For this phase, I had to look at the the datasets both visually and programmatically to be able to notice and assess any possible quality or tidiness issue in the datasets before cleaning them in the next phase.

## DATA CLEANING 

Data cleaning basically involves tackling the quality and tidiness issues that were note in the previous phase - Data assessing. With the use of formulas, functions and loops, most of the issues were cleaned. 

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

This WhatsApp Chat analysis covers the following aspect;

- Importing the necessary python libraries; regrex, panda, numpy, emoji, matplotlib and wordcloud.
- Preparing the Data using Python function before Importing it.
- Importing the Data Set - Whatsapp Chat.
- Displaying the first 20 conversation in the Data set - WhatsApp chat.
- Displaying the toal number of messages in the Data Set - whatsapp Chat.
- Displaying th total number media messages in the Data Set - Whatsapp Chat.
- Displaying the Total Number of Emojis Present in the Data Set - Whatsapp Chat.
- Displaying the Total Chat Analysis present in the Data Set - Whatsapp Chat.
- Graphical Representation of the most Emojis used in the Data Set - WhatsApp Chat.
- Total number of words present and its Graphical Representation in the Data Set - WhatsApp Chat.


## CONCLUSION 
WhatsApp has quickly become the world's most popular text and voice messaging application. In this WhatsApp chat analysis I found out interesting insights about the total messages between both parties and also the most used word.
